# Job Portal (Work in Progress)

Welcome to the Job Portal project! This is an ongoing project aimed at creating a comprehensive job portal where users can find job listings, apply for jobs, manage applications, and employers can post jobs and manage applications.

## Current Status

This project is currently in development. While the core functionality is being implemented, certain features may not be fully functional or polished yet. We're actively working on adding new features and improving existing ones.

## Features

- **Admin Panel**: An admin panel is being developed to manage users, job listings, and applications. This will provide administrative control over the entire system.
  
- **Employer Panel**: Employers will have access to a panel where they can post job listings, view applications, and manage their job postings.
  
- **User Dashboard**: Users will have a dashboard where they can view job listings, apply for jobs, and manage their applications.

- **Application Management**: Users can apply for jobs through the portal and manage their applications, including viewing, editing, and deleting them.

- **Employer Application Management**: Employers can view applications submitted for their job listings, manage them, and take actions such as accepting or rejecting applications.
